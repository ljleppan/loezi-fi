So what’s that all about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep the background short, I’ll just quote the general project description from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://immersiveautomation.com/&quot;&gt;Immersive Automation website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Immersive Automation-project is a research consortium where data scientists, linguists, and journalists work together with researchers and media companies to bring forward a solution for producing engaging, data driven content. Our aim is to create a roadmap and a demonstration of a future news ecosystem based on automated storytelling, intense audience engagement, and user experience. The duration of the project is until end of May 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s a lot of fancy words. In practice, I’ve worked since the start of the year on a prototype for automated news generation in multiple languages. Our first prototype, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vaalibotti.fi?language=en&quot;&gt;Valtteri&lt;/a&gt; was up and running just in time for the Finnish municipal elections of 2017. It obtained some media attention &lt;a href=&quot;http://kuntalehti.fi/kuntauutiset/paatoksenteko/ylen-uutisrobotti-nakuttaa-vaalitulosuutisia-sekunnin-murto-osassa/&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hs.fi/blogi/datablogi/art-2000005166354.html&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hs.fi/paivanlehti/12042017/art-2000005166354.html&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.helsinki.fi/sv/aktuellt/valtteri-skriver-sjalvstandigt-nyheter-pa-flera-sprak&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tekes.fi/nyt/uutiset-2017/valtteri-botti-tuottaa-itsenaisesti-vaaliuutisia-eri-kielilla/&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vtt.fi/medialle/uutiset/valtteri-botti-tuottaa-itsen%C3%A4isesti-vaaliuutisia-usealla-kielell%C3%A4&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; by being able to generate around 750 000 different news articles in each of the three languages it knows. What I personally view as the biggest achievement is that we’re doing some surprisingly complicated stuff behind the scenes and still achieving speeds that make the system usable as a real-time web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this first prototype is lacking in some key areas, it seems like a promising step forwards in our project.  After all, we’re only four months in to the 18 month journey, and already have big plans on how to take things much further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I’ll probably create a few blog posts in the future on how Valtteri works and what exactly led to that architecture. I’ll also expand upon how we plan to continue the research now that the first prototype is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ps.

&lt;p&gt;The title of my thesis is one of those word monsters that tend to exist only in the domain on thesis names: “&lt;em&gt;Using element-level website usage data to improve online learning materials and predict learning outcomes&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data for the thesis comes from a JavaScript component embedded into an online learning material used in a programming course. The component – called “Pheromones” –  collects log data of how students behave in the material. We log what the elements the student has visible on their screen after every scroll event, and every 2.5 seconds in case the students are not mobing the screen. We also log every click made in the material. If the student stays idle for a sufficiently long time, we pause the logging and resume when the screen is interacted with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thesis then takes the data collected using this tool and analyses, combines it with some other data and then does science on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I use the data to identify areas where the students keep returning to all the time. The hypothesis is that such areas are very important and/or have difficult content in them. We can also identify areas where students never come back: either they are easy or the students see them as irrelevant. A preliminary analysis suggested that students tended to ignore everything that has to do with good coding practices and keep returning to places where new syntax and features of the language are presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I check whether the time students spend with assignment prompts on their screens correlate with self-reported perceptions of assignment difficulty, workload or educational value. Spoiler alert: they do not. once the others are corrected for. I believe this to be caused by a phenomena where in very difficult cases the students start searching for information from elsewhere, causing them to spend less time looking at the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, I attempt to predict student learning outcomes based on their movement statistics. Just knowing the per-student proprotions of where the students spend their times (in other words, discarding information about student effort) allows for fairly strong predictions of the total course scores of the students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the techniques used in my thesis are not really dependent on the programming education environment, I have a strong belief that they can be applied to other subjects as well. But that’s for future work to determine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more details on the first research question, check out “&lt;em&gt;Using and Collecting Fine-Grained Usage Data to Improve Online Learning Materials&lt;/em&gt;” once the ICSE 2017 proceedings come out. There’s also other some other stuff related to my thesis in review for various conferences, but only time will tell when/if those get published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the thesis itself, it’ll be available online once it’s accepted. The timeline for that has been “one or two more weeks” for the last four months, so it should get finished any minute now :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There’s even an argument to be made that the distinction between the fields is very arbitrary and they are in practice the same thing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started in the Agile Education Research Group RAGE in the summer of 2014, still working at the time on my bachelor’s degree in language technology. While my original focus was on developing the University of Helsinki’s programming assignment submission and checking system &lt;a href=&quot;http://testmycode.github.io/&quot;&gt;TestMyCode&lt;/a&gt;, I quickly started to participate in some of the research done within the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lead to a strong love for the learning analytics and educational data mining fields, where I’ve so far published 3 articles with one more in press and four in review. I ended up changing majors to Computer Science and selecting a learning analytics focused topic for my master’s thesis. Unfortunately, during the late 2016 it became apparent that the research group would not be able to fully fund my upcoming PhD studies. It was time to look around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up working for around three months for the Tampere University of Technology – we’d previously collaborated with them on some of the papers – at the end of 2016. During this time, I heard of a wonderful new opportunity at the Discovery group of UH CS Department: they were starting a project called &lt;a href=&quot;http://immersiveautomation.com/&quot;&gt;Immersive Automation&lt;/a&gt; to study the automation of newsrooms and news production. I applied and was accepted to join the 18 month project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the physical move was a small one (from one end of the building to the other), the shift in terms of the research problems and the group dynamics was huge. Yet, I embrace this change wholehartedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not a believer in “all change is good”, and change for change’s sake. But I do recognice that change of perspective brings forth new ideas and causes one to evaluate the previously set-in-stone things. These first four months have been of constant learning and I believe that the skills that I’ve learned here will be valuable, whether my future research is in educational data mining an learning analytics or natural language generation. Or perhaps I’ll end up working on some combination of these fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ljleppan</name></author><summary type="html">Changing jobs is always exiting, especially when that change is accompanied by a change in the field of research.</summary></entry></feed>
