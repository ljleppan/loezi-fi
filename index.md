I'm a Computer Science PhD student in the [Discovery research group](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/computational-creativity-and-data-mining) at the University of Helsinki Department of Computer Science.

My research background includes educational data mining, learning analytics and natural language generation for automated news generation.

I'm interested in web technologies, user experience, natural language processing, machine learning and programming in general.

On the free time I dabble in history, reading everything I can.

Previously I have also done odd jobs as a part-time-instructor for the University of Helsinki CS Dept. and the University of Helsinki Open University. Courses I have been involved with include Introduction to Programming, Advanced Course in Programming, Methods of Software Engineering, Software Engineering, Software Engineering project, Server-side web developement (both Java and Ruby on Rails) etc.

I'm proficient in Java, Python, Ruby on Rails, HTML(5), JavaScript, CSS, LESS and other associated web technologies.
