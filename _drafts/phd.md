Universities seem like weird places, living in a perpetual state of insolvency and too much money. 

A year ago, I had to change research groups because my old group did not have enough funding to commit to paying my salary for the four years my PhD studies were intended do take. It's probably a good thing we didn't take a jump into the darkness with just hiring me and thinking we'd figure it out later: my intended "start of January, 2017" MSc graduation date got pushed back all the way to "end of November, 2017".

At the new group, I've been working on a 1.5 year research project that seems to have more money than we know what to do with: we're still actively hiring with only 6 months to go in the project, and I've never been more free to travel to conferences abroad. But at the same time, that money came with a hard deadline that is approaching fast. I remember looking at the calendar a month or two ago and starting to worry a bit; clearly I wouldn't be able to complete my PhD in 7 months (I hadn't even officially graduated as a master's student back then!) and no additional funding had yet been secured. Where would I get the money to complete my studies?

And then, over a few days, everything changed again. I received a personal 4-year grant that allows me to fully focus on my PhD. And a large international research project application that my group is part of got accepted. Suddenly, we are in this weird place where there's money for salaries but not enough people to pay. It's a peculiar systems, one of periods of "we don't know what to do with this money" interleaved by "there's no funding". 

I'm honestly not quite certain how I should think about the system, in terms of my personal financial security. On one hand, one is never fully "secure" in the academia; you can't just go on cruise control. At the same time, the long but temporary positions ensure that it's
